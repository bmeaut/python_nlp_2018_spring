Note that the uni- and bigrams collected in the [HMM Training slide](#hmm_training) are not the general uni- or bigram distributions, as we only collect $n-1$, $n-2$, etc.-grams at the beginning of sentences. This is the reason why you can use the unigram distribution for $T_{i,1}$ $-$ and also why you should use them **only** there.\n",
    "1. The pages above described the Viterbi algorithm for bigram ($n=2$) transition probabilities. When going to $n=3$ (and beyond):\n",
    "    * the transition probabilities have the form $\\mathbb{P}(l_t\\ |\\ l_{t-1},l_{t-2})$\n",
    "    * at the beginning of the sentence, use the unigram distribution for the first word and the bigram for the second\n",
    "    * consequently, the tables must have $n$ dimensions: $|L|\\times|L|\\times N$ for $n=3$, etc.\n",
    "    * let's say that the second dimension corresponds to the current tag, the first to the previous one\n",
